# Parallel Quick Sort

Use C language with MPI and OpenMP Library to build a parallel quick sort.

## Performance Analysis

Analyze performance of your parallel application, using Amdahl’s model and analytical model.

## Graphs

Draw the Speed-up and Efficiency graph: must show an ideal line, Amdahl’s line, analytical line, and experimental runtime line with 1, 2, 4, 8 number of processors (cores/ranks).
